# QuarkOS

A simple 32 bit, graphical, OS written in C++.


## Building
1. Install python3, make
2. You will need to build a i686-elf-gcc cross compiler. There are not fixed requirements for it, so long as the commands `i686-elf-gcc`, `i686-elf-ar`, `qemu-system-i386` are in the `PATH`
See [here](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler) for building 
3. `cd src`
4. Run `./build.sh` to build, `./qemu.sh` to build and run, `./start.sh` to run or `./build.sh` to build

## Note
The system is by no means well tested, it works on my machine and that's about as much as I can guarantee :)

## Structure
```
src - The root of all source code
	kernel
		arch/i386 - Mostly boot code for the kernel.
		include/kernel - Mapped into sysroot/usr/include/kernel on build
		kernel - Kernel C++ source
			hardware - Code relating specifically to interacting with hardware devices, whether that is the CPU, keyboard, mouse, monitor or something lower level
	libc
		arch/i386 - At the time of writing contains only the crt0
		include - Mapped into sysroot/usr/include on build
	user - All userspace code goes in here
		windowserver
			server - The server process
			client - The client windowserver library
			utils - Code accessible by both the server and the client
		calc.c - A simple GUI calculator
		dock.c - An application started by the windowserver which opens other apps
		font.c - Font viewer
		guiapp.c - A demonstration of windowserver code
		hello.c - Probably won't work any more, was made for the command line interface which no longer exists
		ps.c - Lists all running processes
		shell.c - A shell for the command line interface
	buildtar.py - Creates the .tar file which acts as the file system (for now)
