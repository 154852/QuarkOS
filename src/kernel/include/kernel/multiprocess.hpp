namespace MultiProcess {
    /*
Processes have states, a process running in it's normal state, will be switching between Running, and Runnable.
A process is Running if it is the process running right now.
A process is Runnable if it could be the process running, say on the next rotation.
A process is Exitting if it should be opened again, and will be removed on the next cycle.
A process is Idle if it should be given no computation time unless there is no other process running. This should only be used for the idle process.

Asyncronous syscall actions (such as reading a file), are handled by wait task callbacks. If the process is Waiting, that means that the processes thread execution time is being used by the wait task.
Wait tasks run in the kernel, outside of an interrupt, but are still ring 3. A process should mark itself as BeginWaiting, when it wants to start a wait process, then it will be automatically switched to Waiting once the wait process ahas started, 
then once the wait process is finished, it should be switched to EndWaiting.

Syncronous syscall actions (such as switching page directory), are handled bu ring0task callbacks. This should be marked by setting process.ring0_request.has_ring0_request = true.
Ring0SyncRequests is run as a callback before the next time slice of the process. It is run in the kernel, inside an interrupt, at ring 0.
